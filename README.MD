  Good afternoon!
  I hope you are doing great. I hope that in the future we will be able to meet in person, not only through documentation:)

  There are a few things I would like to discuss, if we communicate not through README:

1)The first thing you need to do to start the application is to create a database and export a backup(backup_jair.backup).

2)The frontend archive contains the frontend application. It runs on localhost 8080. I don't have much experience with the frontend, but I did what I could. 

3)The tenios-jair_eisakov-4d3358d4fb99.rar archive contains the application backend. It runs on localhost 8081. Regarding the backend I didn't have time to do the sending of images by list, because I need to implement the serializer, but I didn't have time for that.
  Also made 2 different authentication one works on the client side, the other on the server side.
  
4)jair.postman_collection contains a collection of postmans for testing handlers.

  Have a great day! See you soon, hope to discuss all questions in person on the call.
  Sincerely, Evgenii Isakov
